**SECTION 1: PEER REVIEW AUDIT**
* **Valid Points (Incorporated):** 
    * The Peer Examiner correctly identified that all mathematical content and derivative formulas presented are factually accurate.
    * The Peer Examiner noted the comprehensive coverage of standard AP Calculus BC derivative formulas (Power Rule, Trig, Inverse Trig, Exponential, and Logarithmic).

* **Invalid/Rejected Points:** 
    * **Format/Context Deduction:** The Peer Examiner assigned a score of 12/100 primarily because the submission is an instructional video rather than a traditional student-examiner dialogue. Under the Adjudication Standards, I am required to "Grade strictly on content mastery" and "disregard potential cheating or audio quality issues." Rejecting the response based on its "instructional video" format violates the directive to evaluate the content regardless of the medium or context of the recording.
    * **Depth of Understanding (0/40):** The Peer Examiner awarded zero points here. I reject this because the speaker demonstrates depth by explaining the necessary algebraic transformations (e.g., rewriting $1/x$ as $x^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{x}$ as $x^{1/2}$) to apply the power rule. This shows a conceptual grasp of the mechanics, not just rote memorization.
    * **Clarity (0/20):** The Peer Examiner awarded zero points because it "fails as an exam response." This is rejected. The presentation of the material is exceptionally clear and coherent, which is the standard for this category.

**SECTION 2: FINAL EVALUATION**
* **Factual Accuracy:** Perfect. The student correctly identified derivatives for the power rule, all six trigonometric functions, all six inverse trigonometric functions, and multiple exponential/logarithmic bases (including $e$, $a$, $\ln$, and $\log_{10}$).
* **Depth & Understanding:** High. The student consistently explains the "how" behind the power rule applications and correctly identifies the role of the natural log in non-e bases for both exponents and logarithms.
* **Clarity:** Exceptional. Each rule is stated clearly with appropriate pauses and step-by-step logic for more complex radical/rational forms.

**SECTION 3: FINAL SCORE**
**Final Grade: 100/100**
